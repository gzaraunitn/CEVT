## Requirements
* Python 3.6+, PyTorch 1.1+, CUDA 10.0+

## Datasets
Experiments are conducted on four datasets: UCF-HMDB<sub>small</sub>, UCF-HMDB<sub>full</sub>, UCF-Olympic.

The downloaded files need to store in `./dataset`.

Pre-extracted features and data lists can be downloaded as,

## Datasets Split
For the open-set domain adaptation task, we need to keep source samples with **known** classes 0, 1, ..., C-1, C only and remove all source samples with classes C+1, C+2, ... We also need to change the unkown classes (C+1, C+2, ...) of target samples to (C+1), which is **unknown** class. To complete the datasets splitting, follow the steps below as an example of **Olympic â†’ UCF**:

1. rename the source list "dataset/olympic/list_olympic_train_ucf_olympic-feature.txt" to "dataset/olympic/list_olympic_train_ucf_olympic-feature_org.txt" ("org" means "original", which is used to backup the original list.)
2. rename the target list "dataset/ucf101/list_ucf101_val_ucf_olympic-feature.txt" to "dataset/ucf101/list_ucf101_val_ucf_olympic-feature_org.txt".
3. In the script **open_set_data.py**, follow the comments to understand and set the variables as you need. 
4. Run **open_set_data.py**.
5. According to the number of known classes you choose, remove lines of unknown classes in the file "data/classInd_ucf_olympic.txt". Also, remember to keep the original file.
